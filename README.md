EKI.jl 

This module provides an all-julia implementation of Ensemble Kalman Inversion, a derivative-free optimizer based on the ensemble Kalman filter. It comes in 2 flavours ``natural'' - which mimics the mathematical notation of Iglesias 2016 *A regularising iterative ensemble Kalman method for PDE-constrained inverse problems*, and a lower-memory usage version for larger datasets.
